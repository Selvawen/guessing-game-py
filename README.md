# guessing-game-py
This is a simple guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

## Features
- User Interaction: The program interacts with the user by prompting them to guess a number and providing feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Looping: The game allows the user to play multiple times if desired by looping until the user decides to stop.
- Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number using Python's random module.
- Function-based Structure: The program is structured using functions to organize different parts of the game logic.

2. Run the Python file in your preferred Python environment (e.g., IDLE, command line) to start the game.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number.
